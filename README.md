# 🌐 Eloquent Journal

Welcome to **Eloquent Journal**, a repository dedicated to documenting my JavaScript studies using *Eloquent JavaScript* (Marijn Haverbeke). This repository contains solved exercises, practical projects, and notes about the language and its concepts — organized for clarity and reuse.

---

## 📁 Repository structure

The repository is organized by book chapters and projects. Each exercise or relevant file lives in its own file to keep the repository navigable.

```text
├── chapters/
│   ├── ch02/
│   │   ├── ch02-ex1_minimum.js
│   │   └── ch02-ex2_recursion.js
├── projects/
│   ├── todo-list/
│   ├── simple-game/
│   └── api-client/
└── README.md
```

## ▶️ How to run the code

You can run the exercise files or small scripts with Node.js. Replace `path/to/script.js` with the actual file path.

On Windows (PowerShell):
```powershell
node path\to\script.js
```
On Linux / macOS (bash):
```bash
node path/to/script.js
```
In the browser:
Create a simple HTML file and include the script:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
  <title>Eloquent JS Exercise</title>
</head>
<body>
  <script src="path/to/script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

## 🎯 Objectives

- Document my study progress through *Eloquent JavaScript*
- Solve the book exercises with well-commented code
- Build practical projects that apply the learned concepts
- Share solutions and insights with the community
- Establish a solid base of knowledge in modern JavaScript

## 🌍 Why JavaScript?

JavaScript is the language of the web and serves as a bridge between ideas and interactive experiences. It enables:

- The creation of interactive interfaces and applications available globally
- Rapid prototyping and experimentation across client and server environments
- A broad ecosystem for building tools, visualizations, and games
- Continuous evolution that keeps the language relevant for both frontend and backend development

*Eloquent JavaScript* stands out because it emphasizes computational thinking, not just syntax. It teaches how to reason about problems, abstractions, and systems.

## 🛠️ Development environment

Targets:
- Node.js for scripting and server-side experiments
- Chromium-based browsers for client-side testing

Tools:
- Plain JavaScript (ES6+)
- Visual Studio Code
- Browser console and Node REPL for debugging
